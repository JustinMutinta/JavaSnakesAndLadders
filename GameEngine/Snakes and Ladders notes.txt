Calculating location to Array:

1[0,0] to 9[0,8] (left to right) #location is second number -1

19[1,1] to 11[1,9] (right to left) # location is first number minus 1, 10 minus second number

21[2,0] to 29[2,8] (left to right) #location is second number minus 1

39[3,1] to 31[3,9] (right to left)

41[4,0] to 49[4,8] (left to right)


 1 to 10 #location is second number minus 1
11 to 20 #location is 
21 to 30
31 to 40
41 to 50

20[1,0] - first number minus 1
40[3,0] - 
60[5,0]

10[0,9] - first number minus 1, second number becomes 9
30[2,9]
50[4,9]
